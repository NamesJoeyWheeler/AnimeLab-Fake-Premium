# AnimeLab Fake Premium

**NOTE: This does not give you premium AnimeLab features like 1080p, dubs, etc. It does however remove ads from the site (just not the ads that play on shows).**

*Q. What the heck is this?*

This is a set of TamperMonkey scripts that make it look like you have AnimeLab premium (even though you don't).

*Q. What difference does it make?*

-It replaces the AnimeLab logo with an AnimeLab Premium logo.

-It removes ads that show up when you browse the site.

-It removes the 'Premium Only' text that appears on some videos on the front page (**THIS DOES NOT ALLOW YOU TO WATCH PREMIUM ONLY SHOWS WITHOUT PREMIUM!**).
