# AnimeLab Fake Premium

**NOTE: This does not give you premium AnimeLab features like 1080p, dubs, etc. It does however remove ads from the site (just not the ads that play on shows).**

*Q. What the heck is this?*

This is a set of TamperMonkey scripts that make it look like you have AnimeLab premium (even though you don't).

*Q. What difference does it make?*

-It replaces the AnimeLab logo with an AnimeLab Premium logo.

-It removes ads that show up when you browse the site.

-It removes the 'Premium Only' text that appears on some videos on the front page (**THIS DOES NOT ALLOW YOU TO WATCH PREMIUM ONLY SHOWS WITHOUT PREMIUM!**).

*Q. How do I install this?*

-First you must install TamperMonkey for Chrome.

*This can be found here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo*

-Next you must go to the raw page of each script in this repository. It should bring up a TamperMonkey page asking if you want to install. Install them.

-They should now work!


*Q. Are There Any Problems*

Yes, this still has some problems. Here's a list of 'em.

-Profile page does not change.

-Not all of the 'Premium Only' text on the home page goes away. If you click the arrow for 'Recently Aired', you will see shows that still have the text.

-Premium only shows still have a countdown attached.



*Q. Will there be any future features?*

There are some features that I would like to add in the future.

-Profile page shows a 'premium subscription'.

-Remove 'Switch to Dub Dubbed Premium' box on video and replace it with regular 'Switch to Dub' box.

-Replace the red '720p Premium' & '1080p Premium' options in video and replace them with regular '720p' and 1080p' boxes.
